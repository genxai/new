> Generate anything. Personalized. Any model.

## Setup

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation). Then run `task setup` & follow instructions until it says `✔️ you are setup`.

## Run

Run `task` to see all possible commands.

## Docs

Proper docs will be setup & published soon.

For now, good thing to know is that the project was started from [this template](https://github.com/Topfi/BetterAuth-Convex-9ui-shadcn-CLI-) & originally was meant as submission for [Modern Stack Hackathon](https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/modernstack).

Also the choice of Convex as tech was guided by Convex kindly open sourcing [Chef](https://github.com/get-convex/chef) which we will use to build our own code generation system.

## Contributing

Any PR to improve is welcome. [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) & [cursor](https://cursor.com) are nice for dev. Great **working** & **useful** patches are most appreciated (ideally).
